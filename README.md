# 🩸 VWD Education App for Kids (WIP)

An educational mobile app for children with Von Willebrand Disease (VWD), designed to teach key medical facts, safety behaviors, and emergency responses through interactive mini-games. Built with Flutter and Firebase, and focused on gamified health education.

> 🚧 This project is currently in progress. Game mechanics, visuals, and logic are actively being refined.

## 🎯 Problem & Motivation

Children with VWD often struggle to understand why bruising, bleeding, and lifelong medication compliance matter. Traditional handouts are text-heavy and ineffective for pediatric learning. This app turns essential VWD knowledge into a game-like experience that’s easy to understand and fun to use.
